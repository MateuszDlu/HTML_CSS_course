    <p class="hello-there">Hello there!</p>
    <p class="general-grievous">General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering... Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!</p>
    <p class="scene-desc">About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS. <br>They stare at each other for a moment.</p>
    <p class="general-grievous">Enough of this.</p>
    <p class="scene-desc">The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury. <br>OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.</p>
    <p class="general-grievous">Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.</p>
    <p class="obi-wan">Your move.</p>
    <p class="general-grievous">You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by <span class="count-dooku">Count Dooku</span> himself. Attack, Kenobi.</p>
    <p class="scene-desc">His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.</p>
    <p class="obi-wan">You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated <span class="count-dooku">Count Dooku</span>!</p>
